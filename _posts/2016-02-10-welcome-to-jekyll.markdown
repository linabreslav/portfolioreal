This was potentially the most productive weekend of my entire life — and it disappeared in a flash of code and business card design and trading war stories with the Python class at The Iron Yard Durham. Here’s what I did: met the Python class, came up with an exciting idea for my final project, took a PHP course with Girl Develop It RDU, did homework for said class, ran two usability tests on Elfster.com and wrote up some results, coded for approx. 14 hours on the Goodreads re-design that I’m polishing up for my portfolio, designed and ordered business cards, chose a wedding venue, and somehow did some grocery shopping too .

front-of-card design- yes, it’s square!
A little bit of background on me: after graduating from Wesleyan in 2013, I worked three really cool years as public policy/ public health researcher at the Urban Institute in Washington, DC. Besides falling in love with DC, I contributed to deeply meaningful and challenging work swimming in incredible data with a lot of the most brilliant people in the entire world. I was one of the lucky few new-college-graduates who enjoyed their work directly after college. So why am I not in a PhD program preparing to return to the think tank world?
The answer is simple: flow state. Flow state is the place you go when time is irrelevant, you are completely living in “the moment”, and you aren’t sure if you’ve been doing something for two minutes or two weeks.

Recognize this? This isn’t to say that I didn’t experience flow state at work. In fact, I experienced it as part of a variety of tasks: working with GIS and designing maps, coding in Stata, qualitative interviews with participants, among others.
When I moved to Durham, North Carolina with my fiancé (a PhD student in cognitive neuroscience at Duke), I was weighing my options between three job offers in market research. These were great options, as research is my first love and I intend to be a researcher for life… now I know that this research will take the form of UX. I finally realized I needed to broaden my mind and expand the pieces of my job that I had loved so much (research, design, coding). So I enrolled in the Iron Yard UI/UX Design course and have been coding/designing/researching in what amounts to an entire ocean of flow.
